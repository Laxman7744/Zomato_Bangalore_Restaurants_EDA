# 🍽️ Zomato Bengaluru Restaurants Analysis

## 📖 Description
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Zomato’s Bengaluru restaurant dataset (as of March 15, 2019). It aims to uncover insights on:
- **Demographics & Locations**: Which neighbourhoods have the highest concentration of restaurants?  
- **Cuisine Popularity**: What cuisines dominate each area?  
- **Price & Rating Trends**: How do average costs and ratings compare across neighbourhoods?  
- **Restaurant Characteristics**: Which establishments offer delivery, table booking, buffets, etc.?

By understanding these patterns, new restaurant owners can make data‑driven decisions about theme, menu, pricing, and ideal location.
